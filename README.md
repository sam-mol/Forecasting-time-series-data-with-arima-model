Time series analysis is an important topic in data science. However, we often need to go beyong the analyze of time series data and predict the future values of time series data of interest. There are many classical statistical and machine learning models to choose from for forecasting time series data. In this project I am using a classical statistical model - seasonal ARIMA - to forecast the future values of a time series dataset. I am using the Monthly Milk Production dataset. This dataset contains measurements of milk production in pounds per cow per month from January 1962 to December 1975. I download the Monthly Milk Production dataset and I split the data into two subsets, one for training the model and another for testing the model's predictions. I use Pandas library to read the files and check the data for missing values. I test the data for stationarity and trasform the data to remove any non-stationarity. I visualize the time series and infer the model hyperparameters from ACF and PACF plots. I use a seasonal ARIMA model from statsmodels library. Seasonal ARIMA is a classical time series forecasting model that works well with time series data that contain seesonal variations. I build the seasonal ARIMA model using the hyperparameters infered from ACF and PACF plots. I then train the model on the train subset. I assess the model's accuracy by using the model to make a few predictions for the future values of the time series, and then I compare the predictions with the test dataset. I then provide summary of findings.
